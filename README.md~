# Evil: The Simple Text Editor

I'm making Evil for myself, with all the features that I need and no
more. I won't claim that it'll be good for anyone else. I'm writing it
in Go becouse it needs to be relativly fast but still in a reasonably
high-level language.

## Must-have features:

* VIM keybindings
* Split-window
* Emacs keybindings for window management:
    * <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>x</kbd> <kbd>0</kbd>: Kill window
    * <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>x</kbd> <kbd>3</kbd>: New vertical window
    * <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>x</kbd> <kbd>2</kbd>: Now horizontal window
    * <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>x</kbd> <kbd>o</kbd>: Next window
* Ability to open any repl command in a split window and have it work nicely
* Simple keyword syntax highlighting
* Basic in-file word tab completion
* As-you-type menu of completions from language plugin
* Syntax highlighting and language support plugins written in Lua
* Lua repl available in editor
* Auto parenthises, brace, and quote matching
* Line wrapping at set border
* Line number in bottom bar, no line numbers on side.
